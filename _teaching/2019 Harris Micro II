Teaching a course I designed on microeconomics to 20-30 students in the Master's in Public Policy program at the Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago.  I focus on deviations from perfect competition, including market power and market failure.  The course uses calculus, and emphasizes the applied and public policy relevance of economic theory.  The course syllabus is available [here](http://levyjeff.github.io/files/Micro2_Spring2019.pdf).
