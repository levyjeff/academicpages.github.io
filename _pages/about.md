Welcome, and thanks for visiting my site!  I am a PhD candidate in economics who works at the intersection data science and social science.  I get my hands into a wide variety of projects in my current role at the Urban Institute, as part of a small team that partners with researchers whose work faces advanced technical hurdles.  My understanding of research methods, econometrics and programming allows me to contribute in meaningful ways to nearly any research.

My PhD dissertation, which I aim to complete in late 2018 or early 2019, is in the field of empirical macroeconomics.  Specifically, I study the causes and impacts of economic uncertainty on the real economy, following a long line of economists from [Keynes](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/51/2/209/1939387), [Knight](https://mises.org/sites/default/files/Risk,%20Uncertainty,%20and%20Profit_4.pdf), [Bernanke](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/98/1/85/1869115), [Romer](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/105/3/597/1864581) and more recently, [Alexopoulos and Cohen](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/public/workingPapers/tecipa-352.pdf) and [Baker, Bloom and Davis](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/131/4/1593/2468873).  As uncertainty has been shown to be reliably counter-cyclical, unraveling the relationship between uncertainty and the economy has been an active area of research, particularly since the 2007 financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession.

I bring several key principles to my work:
  - A focus on open source software, particularly Python.
  - Strict adherence to what I like to call "Step 0" reproducible research.  As an expert in web scraping, where ever possible all of my projects in both my PhD studies and my work at Urban begin with the programmatic retrieval of raw data from the web, and end with producing the final results.  Anything less greatly hinders troubshooting, and introduces human error into the all-important step of reproducing research results.
  - An emphasis on finding and using unique or hard-to-access data sources that allows for the study of straight-forward questions.
