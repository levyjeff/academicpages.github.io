Myself and a researcher in the Metro Policy Center at the Urban Institute are working with a proprietary dataset of text messages between parole officers and their clients.  This research is still in the development phase, but will involve using Python, natural language processing and ML models with scikit-learn in order to identify risk factors and interventions that improve outcomes for parolees.
