My dissertation uses a database of thousands of small regional news sources to assemble state- and MSA-level economic uncertainty measures. I use Python to retrieve and clean the data, and then perform analysis using two-stage least squared, vector auto regression and difference in difference frameworks in order to better understand both the determinants and effects of exogenous changes in economic uncertainty.

I expect the primary job market paper to be done in the summer, 2018, with the rest following by the end of 2018 or early 2019.
